## Walkthrough of Predicting IgG Titers Using Tidymodels Machine Learning


### Introduction

This repository provides resources for students interested in further exploring systems vaccinology and predicting patient responses to Pertussis vaccination using basic machine learning. Specifically, the following [walkthrough](https://jhsiao12.github.io/CMI-PB_Walkthrough/) builds a customizable tidymodels machine learning prediction of IgG antibody titers against Pertussis toxin (PT) 7 days post-vaccination.

### Get Started

Download the Quarto Document `CMI-PB_Prediction_Walkthrough.qmd` of the step-by-step walkthrough to start modifying and experimenting in Rstudio. The rendered HTML version of this Quarto Document, linked [above](https://jhsiao12.github.io/CMI-PB_Walkthrough/), provides the walkthrough in a more reader-friendly format.

*Note*: The datasets required for the walkthrough should be automatically downloaded using the code in the walkthrough, but are also included in this repository in case the download links embedded in the code don't work.

### CMI-PB Project

This walkthrough was adapted from a modeling attempt at task 1.1 of the 2022 CMI-PB Prediction Challenge on the [CMI-PB website](https://www.cmi-pb.org/). This challenge provides data from individuals who have received a Pertussis booster as a proxy for Pertussis infection. By providing this data, the project aims to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration for predictive modeling of immune responses following Pertussis boost to better characterize the associated immune response to Pertussis vaccinations.
